# FLOWSCRIIPT

Flowscriipt is a platform that allows you to easily create JavaScript components that can be imported into your projects via a CDN. With Flowscriipt, you can save time and effort by creating powerful components without the need for extensive coding knowledge. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Flowscriipt makes it easy to create professional-grade components that can be easily integrated into your projects.

## Usage

To use Flowscriipt, simply copy the CDN links for the components you want to use and paste them into your HTML file. Then, modify the attributes of the script tag to customize the functionality of the component. For example:

```html
<script
  async
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/manuelogomigo/flowscriipt/scroll-progress/script.js"
></script>
```

Replace component-name with the name of the component you want to use, and add any additional attributes as needed. Once you've added the script tag to your HTML file, the component will be available for use in your project.
